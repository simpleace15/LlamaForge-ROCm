# LlamaForge-ROCm

> **A fork of [LlamaForge](https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge) adding
> ROCm (AMD GPU) support and Docker deployment.** Everything else is upstream
> LlamaForge, kept in sync. This fork is an independent project, not affiliated
> with the upstream LlamaForge maintainer, who is credited below.

A graphical control panel for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp):
build it, keep it current with upstream, discover models that fit your hardware,
tune **every** server parameter per model, and run — all from your browser instead
of hand-editing `models.ini` and long `llama-server` command lines.

**Who it's for:** people who want llama.cpp's speed and control but would rather not
memorize flags, edit config files by hand, or babysit build commands. It assumes
you're comfortable running a setup script once and building llama.cpp for your
machine — both guided from the dashboard. Windows with an NVIDIA GPU is the
primary target (CPU-only works too); **Linux** (NVIDIA/CPU/**AMD ROCm**) and **macOS**
(Apple Silicon, Metal) are supported as an early preview — same dashboard,
`bootstrap.sh` instead of `bootstrap.ps1`. **Looking for something else?** If you want a zero-config, double-click
installer with no compile step, [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai),
[Ollama](https://ollama.com), or [Jan](https://jan.ai) will get you running faster —
LlamaForge trades that for direct, per-model control over the real llama.cpp server.

> LlamaForge is an independent wrapper and is **not affiliated with llama.cpp / ggml-org**.
> All inference, model support, and performance come from llama.cpp (MIT, (c) The ggml
> authors). See [NOTICE](NOTICE). Please support the upstream project.

  <img src="docs/demo.gif" alt="LlamaForge demo — model list, GGUF metadata + presets, side-by-side compare, and copy-paste client config" width="100%">
</p>

## Features

The dashboard is organized as a left **sidebar** (collapsible between a compact
icon rail and a labeled view) with these sections. A **first-run wizard** and a
**Lite / Advanced** mode toggle keep it approachable: Lite hides the deep knobs
and a hardware **auto-tune** proposes per-model settings sized to your VRAM, while
Advanced exposes every server flag.

| View | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| **Models** | Every model on your machine in one list with live GPU VRAM/util/temp meters (used **and** free). Expand a model to edit all **~220 llama.cpp knobs** (context, KV-cache type, speculative decoding, tensor split, sampling, rope, ...), grouped and searchable, with the file path, on-disk size, and a **GGUF metadata card** (architecture, parameters, quantization, trained context, layers, attention heads, rope). Save hot-reloads with no restart; **quick-load/unload right from the row header**, with load requests **queued** so a second load waits its turn. A failed load shows the **real error inline with a suggested fix** instead of making you scroll the log. Save any knob set as a **named preset** and apply it to any model in one click, **compare** 2–3 models side-by-side to see what differs, and copy a ready-to-paste **curl / OpenAI-client / JSON** snippet per model. A **Refine** button benchmarks knob variants with real completion requests and applies the fastest config. A full **keyboard map** drives the view, and the expanded row + unsaved edits persist across reloads. |
| **Stats** | Per-model usage tracked from the router's own metrics: tokens processed, average generation speed (tok/s), run counts, time loaded, and a stacked prompt/generated activity chart (14- or 30-day). Live throughput while a model runs. Resettable. (Totals are per-model across all clients — per-request/per-IP isn't shown because clients hit the router directly, so the dashboard never sees individual request origins.) |
| **Discover** | Search **huggingface.co** for **GGUF** (llama.cpp) or **safetensors** (vLLM) models (newest / most downloaded / most liked). Every quant is rated against your hardware - **FITS / TIGHT / CPU OFFLOAD** (offload-aware, so a big MoE that runs fast with experts on CPU isn't mislabeled) - before you download, and each result is tagged with the platforms it runs on plus **GATED** and **INSTALLED** badges. One click streams the download (multi-shard + vision mmproj handled) with live speed/ETA, **pause/resume** (large downloads resume via HTTP range instead of restarting from zero) and cancel, then registers it in your registry. |
| **Build / Update** | Shows your current llama.cpp commit, checks GitHub for how far behind you are (cached, so opening the view doesn't re-hit GitHub every time — with a manual **Check GitHub now**), and rebuilds via CMake with flags **auto-detected for your CPU/GPU/Apple Silicon** (CUDA arch, AVX-512, quantized-KV flash attention, or Metal). Prior binaries are backed up; the build streams live and reports its duration. Also tracks the installed **vLLM** version against PyPI and updates it in place. |
| **Setup** | Checks prerequisites (Git, CMake, Ninja, Python, C++ compiler, CUDA), installs missing ones **with your permission** (winget/choco on Windows, Homebrew on macOS; exact commands shown on Linux — the dashboard never runs `sudo`) or links official downloads. Detects hardware and scans your drives (or `$HOME` + mounts) for existing GGUF models. **Check for deleted models** prunes registry entries whose file has since been removed from disk. Installs the **vLLM** backend into WSL2 (Windows), and lets you pick a **favourite model to auto-load on launch**. |
| **Context** | A **Context Wiki**: a working directory of Markdown context docs composed into named **profiles** and selected **per model**, then either **injected** into requests (through the Anthropic and OpenAI proxies) or **exported** into an agent's native context file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) inside a managed marker region. The injected prefix is stable, so the router's prompt cache reuses it across requests. |
| **Help** | The full LlamaForge documentation, rendered **in-app** from the same Markdown source that builds the published docs site — searchable, with a per-page table of contents. |

## Use it as an agent endpoint

LlamaForge serves your local models to clients written for either major API, and
wires popular coding agents up in one click:

- **OpenAI-compatible** `/v1/chat/completions` (the llama.cpp router) and an
  **Anthropic-compatible** `POST /v1/messages` **shim** on the panel — full SSE
  streaming and tool use — so tools built for either API run against local models.
- **One-click "Connect an Agent"** generates, and optionally writes, the config for
  **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **pi.dev** pointed at your endpoint (Claude Code
  scoped to `127.0.0.1`; any file it touches is backed up first).
- **Load/unload** endpoints let an agent swap models on demand, and the **Context
  Wiki** can inject standing project knowledge into every request.

## Themes & accessibility

A **Light** theme sits alongside the original dark one (the amber terminal identity
adapts rather than inverting), and an independent **Colorblind-safe** mode applies a
universal Okabe–Ito status palette plus non-color cues (glyphs and labels) so status
never depends on hue alone. The two are orthogonal — all four combinations are
valid — and each choice persists per device (`localStorage` > `config.json` > OS).

## Engines: llama.cpp, ik_llama, and vLLM

LlamaForge is a llama.cpp control panel first. It can also build and drive **[ik_llama.cpp](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp)** as a second llama-family engine — switch between them on the **Build** tab (the switch is refused if the chosen binary lacks llama.cpp's router mode, so it can never take the router down), each with its own registry and per-model knobs.

For non-GGUF models it can also drive **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)** as a separate backend for full-precision / safetensors models (FP16, BF16, AWQ, GPTQ, FP8, NVFP4). All engines share the same Models list, Discover tab, and stats — each row is tagged **llama.cpp**, **ik_llama**, or **vLLM**.

- **Windows:** vLLM runs inside **WSL2** with GPU passthrough. Install it from the **Setup** tab (uv + a standalone Python into `~/.llamaforge/vllm-venv`, no `sudo`); the dashboard bridges WSL's localhost port back to Windows. vLLM runs one model at a time and has no hot reload, so saving knobs on a loaded model restarts it — startup can take 1–5 minutes; watch the **vLLM Log** panel.
- **Linux / macOS:** vLLM is a Windows/WSL2 feature; its tab and Discover's safetensors mode are hidden automatically. llama.cpp (CUDA/CPU on Linux, Metal on Apple Silicon) is the engine there.

Everything you download for vLLM lands in the WSL model cache and is registered like any other model. If you only ever want llama.cpp, you can ignore vLLM entirely — nothing about it is installed unless you ask.

## Cross-platform

The same dashboard runs everywhere; only the launcher scripts differ.

| | Windows | Linux | macOS (Apple Silicon) |
|---|---|---|---|
| llama.cpp | CUDA / CPU | CUDA / CPU | Metal |
| vLLM | via WSL2 | — | — |
| bootstrap | `bootstrap.ps1` | `bootstrap.sh` | `bootstrap.sh` |
| daily run | `LlamaForge.vbs` | `./run.sh` | `./run.sh` |
| package manager (Setup tab) | winget / choco | apt / dnf / pacman *(commands shown, never auto-`sudo`)* | Homebrew |

## ROCm (AMD GPU) support

This fork adds **ROCm/HIP** as a first-class accelerator alongside CUDA/CPU/Metal.
On a Linux host with AMD GPUs, the Setup and Build tabs detect them and build
llama.cpp with `GGML_HIP=ON` instead of CUDA.

- **AMD device detection** reads the ROCm KFD topology (`/sys/class/kfd/kfd/topology/nodes`)
  plus the DRM render nodes (`/dev/dri/renderD*`), so it works with just the
  `amdgpu` kernel driver loaded — no `rocm-smi` binary required. Live
  util/temp/used telemetry uses `rocm-smi` when present and falls back to
  VRAM-only KFD data otherwise.
- **Configurable `AMDGPU_TARGETS`.** The build targets a broad default set of
  AMD architectures (Vega, MI100/MI200/MI300, RX 5000/6000/7000). Narrow it to
  your own GPU(s) for a much faster build by setting `amd_gpu_targets` in
  `config.json` (e.g. `"gfx1030;gfx1100"`), or pass `--build-arg AMDGPU_TARGETS=...`
  when building the Docker image. Detected archs are used automatically when
  the key is left blank.
- **AMD-aware VRAM-fit ratings.** The Discover tab's FITS/TIGHT/OFFLOAD ratings
  and the "Will it run?" tok/s estimates now include AMD GPUs (VRAM + memory
  bandwidth presets for Instinct, Radeon Pro, and RX 5000/6000/7000 parts).
- **CUDA/CPU/Metal are unchanged** — ROCm is additive. On a machine with both
  NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, NVIDIA is detected first; on a pure-AMD box the HIP build
  is selected automatically.

## Docker deployment

A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` build the ROCm variant of llama.cpp and
run the LlamaForge backend in a container — the intended way to run this on
**Unraid** (or any Docker host with AMD GPUs).

```bash
# Build (narrow AMDGPU_TARGETS to your GPU for a faster build)
docker build --build-arg AMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -t llamaforge-rocm .

# Or use docker-compose (edit the renderD* device list to match your GPUs first)
docker compose up -d
```

**GPU passthrough is mandatory** — three things must line up or the container
sees zero GPUs:

1. `/dev/kfd` — the ROCm kernel-fusion driver device
2. one render node per GPU — `/dev/dri/renderD128`, `renderD129`, `renderD130`, …
3. `group_add: video` — render nodes are owned `root:video` mode `0660`

The compose file also sets `ipc: host` and a large `shm_size` (llama.cpp needs
big shared memory for multi-GPU and large-context KV caches), and mounts two
volumes: `./config` (config.json, models.ini, logs) and `./models` (your GGUF
files). The dashboard binds `0.0.0.0:8090` and the router `0.0.0.0:8080` inside
the container; set `ROUTER_API_KEY` to require a key on the exposed router.

See [docs/content/docker.md](docs/content/docker.md) for the full Unraid walkthrough.

## Quality-of-life

Small things that add up when you use it every day:

- **Quick-load** — load/unload from the row header without expanding; a **load queue** serializes multiple loads instead of erroring.
- **Named presets** — save a knob set ("coding", "creative", "fast") and apply it to any model in a click, or **bind** one as a model's default so editing the preset re-tunes every model using it.
- **Inline failure diagnosis** — a failed load parses the router log and shows the real error plus a concrete suggested fix (e.g. "lower n-gpu-layers from 99").
- **GGUF metadata card** — architecture, parameter size, quant, trained context, layers, heads, and rope, read straight from the file header.
- **Compare** — pick 2–3 models and see their settings side-by-side with the differences highlighted.
- **Client config** — one click gives you a copy-paste `curl`, OpenAI-client env vars, and a test JSON payload wired to that model's endpoint and API key.
- **Download pause/resume** — a 25 GB download that gets interrupted resumes from where it stopped via an HTTP range request.
- **Auto-load on launch** — pick a favourite model in Setup and it loads itself once the router is ready.
- **Persistent UI** — the expanded row, unsaved edits, favourites, and last Discover search all survive tab switches and reloads.
- **Optional system tray** — a tray icon showing the loaded-model count and a quick "Open dashboard" (Windows/Linux; `pip install pystray pillow` to enable — without it LlamaForge stays pure-stdlib).

## Quick start (new machine)

**Windows**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge
cd LlamaForge
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File bootstrap.ps1
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge
cd LlamaForge
./bootstrap.sh        # then ./run.sh daily, ./stop.sh to shut down
```

The bootstrap script (`bootstrap.ps1` on Windows, `bootstrap.sh` on Linux/macOS)
ensures Python + Git (asking before installing anything), fetches llama.cpp if you
don't have it, writes `config.json`, and opens the dashboard. From there: **Setup**
to install any missing compiler/CUDA and scan your drives, **Build** to compile
llama.cpp for your hardware, **Models** to tune and run. A **Getting Started**
checklist on the Models tab walks you through these three steps on a fresh install.

## Daily use

**Windows:** double-click **`LlamaForge.vbs`**. It starts the llama.cpp router and
the dashboard hidden, then opens your browser. For autostart, put a shortcut to it in
your Startup folder (`Win+R` -> `shell:startup`).

**Linux / macOS:** run **`./run.sh`** — same thing, starts the router and dashboard
and opens your browser.

- Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8090
- llama.cpp chat UI + OpenAI-compatible API: http://127.0.0.1:8080

To shut everything down — the dashboard, the router, and every model instance the
router spawned — run the stop script for your OS:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File stop.ps1   # Windows
./stop.sh                                            # Linux / macOS
```

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (primary), or Linux / macOS (Apple Silicon) as an early preview
- Python 3.10+ (backend is **pure stdlib** - nothing to `pip install`)
- NVIDIA GPU for CUDA acceleration (Metal on Apple Silicon; CPU-only builds also
  supported everywhere)
- Everything else (Git, CMake, Ninja, C++ compiler, CUDA) is detected and can be
  installed from the Setup tab where a package manager allows it
- **vLLM backend (optional, Windows):** WSL2 with GPU passthrough — installed from
  the Setup tab
- **System tray (optional):** `pip install pystray pillow`; without it the tray is
  simply skipped and the backend stays pure-stdlib

## Configuration

All machine-specific paths live in `config.json` (see `config.example.json`):

| key | meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `llama_src` | your llama.cpp git checkout |
| `build_dir` | CMake build directory |
| `server_bin` | path to `llama-server` (`llama-server.exe` on Windows) |
| `models_ini` | the router preset file LlamaForge edits |
| `model_dirs` | directories to scan for GGUFs (empty = all fixed drives) |
| `router_port` / `panel_port` | ports for llama.cpp and the dashboard |
| `router_host` | `127.0.0.1` (default, local only) or `0.0.0.0` (reachable on your LAN) |
| `router_api_key` | key clients send as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; strongly recommended (and enforceable) whenever `router_host` isn't `127.0.0.1` |
| `auto_load_model` | model id to load automatically once the router is ready on launch (`""` = none) |
| `presets` | named knob sets applied from the Models tab, e.g. `{"coding": {"temp": "0.2"}}` |
| `wsl_distro` | WSL distro that runs vLLM (`""` = auto-pick the default) — Windows only |
| `vllm_port` | port vLLM serves on inside WSL, forwarded to Windows localhost |
| `ui_mode` | dashboard control density: `lite` or `advanced` (also toggled in the sidebar) |
| `theme` / `cvd` | appearance: `theme` = `""` (follow OS) / `light` / `dark`, `cvd` = colorblind-safe on/off (also toggled in the sidebar) |
| `anthropic_shim_enabled` / `anthropic_default_model` | serve the Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint, and the model it falls back to |
| `wiki_dir` / `wiki_profiles` / `wiki_active` | Context Wiki: the docs directory, named profiles, and the active profile per model |

Most of these are managed from the dashboard (Setup, Build, the Models view, and the
sidebar controls), so you rarely edit `config.json` by hand. The full key list is in
the in-app **Help** (config.json Reference).

By default everything binds to `127.0.0.1` only. The Setup tab has a **Network
Access** panel to opt into serving the llama.cpp API/chat UI to other devices on
your network (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:8080/`) and restarts the router for you,
no manual editing needed. A **Require an API key** toggle (on by default) blocks
LAN access until you set or generate a key; leaving it unchecked exposes the
router unauthenticated. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## How it works

LlamaForge contains **no llama.cpp source code**. The backend
(`backend/server.py`, pure Python stdlib) proxies llama.cpp's own router API, edits
`models.ini`, and shells out to `git` / `cmake` / `nvidia-smi` and the platform's
package manager (`winget`/`choco`, `brew`, or `apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`). Everything
OS-specific lives behind one small `osplat` module. The knob list is parsed live from
`llama-server --help`, so it stays correct across llama.cpp versions automatically.
HuggingFace downloads are streamed by the backend, so they work even when llama.cpp
is built without SSL.

When models are registered, LlamaForge reads each GGUF's trained context length
straight from its header and writes sensible `ctx-size` defaults into `models.ini`
(a **150k** global baseline; **100k** for models that can't reach it, capped at the
model's own trained length so nothing is over-extended). Per-model settings you set
by hand always win.

## Roadmap

Recent additions: **ik_llama** as a second llama-family engine, **binding a preset**
as a model's default, **auto-wired MTP** draft models, an **offload-aware** VRAM-fit
rating (MoE included), a more forgiving **first run**, and **"built, with warnings"**
for partial builds — on top of **Lite / Advanced modes** with a guided first run and
hardware **auto-tune**, an **Anthropic-compatible endpoint** with one-click **agent
setup** (Claude Code / Codex / pi.dev), a **Context Wiki**, **light/dark +
colorblind-safe** theming, in-app **documentation**, Linux/macOS support, and the
**vLLM** backend (via WSL2 on Windows). Named **knob presets** and binding are the
first steps toward single-click engine+model launch profiles. See
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's shipped, in progress, and planned — it's an early
preview, so priorities follow feedback.

## Credits & license

LlamaForge-ROCm is a fork of **[LlamaForge](https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge)**
by [dadwritestech](https://github.com/dadwritestech), adding ROCm and Docker
support. Both are MIT-licensed ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). It builds and drives
**[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** - MIT, (c) The ggml authors -
see [NOTICE](NOTICE) and [LICENSE.llama.cpp.txt](LICENSE.llama.cpp.txt).
The hard part is theirs; please star and support the upstream projects.

## Keeping in sync with upstream

This fork tracks upstream LlamaForge's `master` branch. To pull in upstream
changes (the ROCm/Docker additions live on top, so a plain merge is usually clean):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge.git  # once
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master --no-edit      # resolve conflicts if any
git push origin master
```

The ROCm/Docker changes are deliberately additive and isolated (a new
`hardware.detect_amd_gpus()` path, a `amd_gpu_targets` config key, and the
`Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml`/`docker-entrypoint.sh` files), so upstream
merges rarely conflict. If a conflict does arise, it will be in `hardware.py`,
`routes.py`, `config.py`, or `README.md` — resolve by keeping both the upstream
change and the ROCm branch.
