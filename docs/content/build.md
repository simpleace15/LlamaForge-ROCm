# Build & Update

Check whether your local llama.cpp checkout is behind upstream, and rebuild it with CMake flags auto-detected for your machine's GPU and CPU — without hand-typing `cmake` commands.

## What it does

The Build tab reports two independent things: how your local `llama_src` checkout compares to upstream `github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp`, and what CMake flags this machine should build with.

**Current vs. upstream.** `backend/builder.py`'s `BuildManager.current_commit()` reads the local checkout's HEAD (`git log -1`) and branch. `check_updates()` runs `git fetch --quiet origin` against `origin/master`, then `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/master` to report how many commits you're behind, plus the latest upstream commit's hash and subject. This check is cached for 15 minutes (`UPDATE_TTL = 900` seconds) so opening the Build tab doesn't `git fetch` GitHub on every visit; a failed fetch is retried sooner (`UPDATE_TTL_FAIL = 60` seconds). The **Check GitHub now** button bypasses the cache with `force=1`, and a finished build clears the cache outright so the next check is fresh.

**Auto-detected build flags.** `backend/hardware.py`'s `recommend()` inspects your GPU(s) (via `nvidia-smi`, or Apple's unified memory on macOS) and CPU, then returns a dict of `{cmake_flags, notes, runtime, gpus, cpu}`:

- On **macOS**, it returns `GGML_METAL=ON` and `GGML_NATIVE=ON`, with a note that Metal uses unified memory as VRAM. No CUDA branch runs on Mac.
- If one or more **AMD GPUs** are detected (ROCm KFD topology + render nodes), it sets `GGML_HIP=ON` and `AMDGPU_TARGETS` to the detected archs (or the configured `amd_gpu_targets` override, falling back to a broad default set). With `amd_backend: "vulkan"` in `config.json`, it instead sets `GGML_VULKAN=ON` (no `AMDGPU_TARGETS`) — the right choice on RDNA2 (gfx1030) cards where ROCm's multi-GPU split collapses to ~7 tok/s but Vulkan holds ~16 tok/s. See [Docker & ROCm](docker.md).
- If one or more **NVIDIA GPUs** are detected, it sets `GGML_CUDA=ON`, and if compute capabilities were readable, `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to the sorted, deduplicated list of detected architectures (e.g. `86;89`). It also sets `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` to enable flash attention across all quantized KV cache combinations.
- If **no GPU** is detected, it configures a CPU-only build (no CUDA/HIP flags) and notes that fact.
- On Windows/Linux either way, it always sets `GGML_NATIVE=ON`. If the CPU looks like it supports AVX-512 (`avx512_hint` — on Linux read from real CPU flags; on Windows a name-based heuristic for Ryzen 7/9 (7000- and 9000-series), Xeon, and Threadripper parts), it additionally sets `GGML_AVX512=ON`, `GGML_AVX512_VNNI=ON`, `GGML_AVX512_VBMI=ON`, and `GGML_AVX512_BF16=ON`.
- It also returns a `runtime` recommendation (not a CMake flag, but a suggested per-model default): `n-gpu-layers=99` and `flash-attn=on` when a GPU (or Mac Metal) is present, `n-gpu-layers=0` and `flash-attn=off` on CPU-only machines.

These flags are shown as pills on the Build tab and used as the default for a rebuild; if you've previously saved custom flags (`cmake_flags` in `config.json`), those are shown instead until you clear them.

A rebuild (`BuildManager.run_build()`) runs in a background thread: it first validates that `llama_src`/`build_dir` are set and the source exists (an unset path is reported plainly instead of running `cmake -B  -S ` and surfacing CMake's own error), optionally `git pull --ff-only origin`, backs up the current binaries directory (`bin/Release` on Windows/MSVC, `bin` elsewhere) to a timestamped copy before touching anything, runs `cmake -B <build_dir> -S <llama_src> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` with your flags, then `cmake --build <build_dir> --config Release --parallel <jobs>`. Output streams to a log file the dashboard polls live. On success it records where `llama-server` actually landed into `config.json`, so a first build doesn't leave you hand-fixing `server_bin`.

**"Built, with warnings."** `cmake --build` returns a single exit code for the whole build, so a failing non-essential target (the npm/`sharp` UI-asset step on Windows is the common one) used to be reported as a hard **BUILD FAILED** even though `llama-server` itself built. Now, if the build step fails but a *freshly built* `llama-server` is present (freshness proven by comparing its mtime to the build's start, so a stale binary from a previous build can't mask a real compile failure), the build is reported as **built, with warnings** — the binary is recorded and usable, and the failing step is left in the log for you to read. A build that produced no fresh binary is still a hard failure.

**Two llama-family engines.** The Build tab has a **llama.cpp / ik_llama** target toggle. Building the `ik_llama` target uses its own `ik_llama_src` / `ik_llama_build_dir` / `ik_llama_cmake_flags` and produces a separate binary. A **Switch engine** control (`POST /api/engine/switch`) points the router at the chosen engine by setting `active_engine`. The switch is gated on a capability probe (`router_ctl.supports_router_mode()`): because LlamaForge drives the router as `<server_bin> --models-preset ...`, a binary whose `llama-server` predates router mode is **refused** with an explanation rather than being switched to and taking the router down. Each engine reads its own `models.ini` (ik_llama uses a `-ikllama` sibling), and the knob editor reflects whichever engine is active.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Build** tab. **Current Build** shows your checkout's commit, branch, and date; **Upstream** shows whether you're behind `origin/master` and by how many commits.
2. Click **Check GitHub now** to force a fresh upstream check instead of waiting for the 15-minute cache.
3. Review the **Build Flags** pills — these are auto-detected for your GPU/CPU (or your previously saved custom flags, if any).
4. Leave **git pull first** checked (it's checked by default when you're behind) to pull the latest commits before building, or uncheck it to rebuild the current checkout as-is.
5. Click **Pull latest & Rebuild** (or **Rebuild current** if already up to date). The build runs in the background; watch progress and any errors in the Build Log panel below, which polls live until the build finishes or fails.
6. If vLLM is installed, the same tab shows its installed vs. latest PyPI version, with an **Update vLLM** button when a newer release is available.

## Reference

| Concept | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Current commit | `BuildManager.current_commit()` | `git log -1` (hash, subject, date) + current branch on `llama_src`. |
| Upstream check | `BuildManager.check_updates()` | `git fetch` + `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/master`; cached 15 min (60s on failure), bypassed with `force=1`. |
| Recommended flags | `hardware.recommend()` | Returns `cmake_flags`, human-readable `notes`, a `runtime` suggestion, and the detected `gpus`/`cpu`. |
| macOS flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_METAL=ON`, `GGML_NATIVE=ON`. |
| AMD (ROCm) flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_HIP=ON`, `AMDGPU_TARGETS=<archs>` (detected, or `amd_gpu_targets` override, else a broad default). |
| AMD (Vulkan) flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_VULKAN=ON` (no `AMDGPU_TARGETS`) when `amd_backend: "vulkan"`. |
| NVIDIA GPU flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_CUDA=ON`, `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<archs>` (if readable), `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON`. |
| CPU-only flags | `hardware.recommend()` | No CUDA/HIP flags; `GGML_NATIVE=ON` still set. |
| AVX-512 flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_AVX512`, `GGML_AVX512_VNNI`, `GGML_AVX512_VBMI`, `GGML_AVX512_BF16` — all `ON` when `avx512_hint` is true. |
| Runtime suggestion | `hardware.recommend()["runtime"]` | `n-gpu-layers=99`, `flash-attn=on` with a GPU/Metal; `n-gpu-layers=0`, `flash-attn=off` CPU-only. |
| Rebuild | `BuildManager.run_build()` | Validates paths, optional `git pull --ff-only`, backs up prior binaries, `cmake` configure + build (Release, parallel jobs = CPU count by default), records the built `server_bin`. |
| Partial success | `BuildManager.run_build()` | Build-step failure with a fresh `llama-server` present → `done_warnings` (amber "built with warnings"); no fresh binary → hard `failed`. |
| Engine target / switch | Build tab toggle, `POST /api/engine/switch` | Builds `llama.cpp` or `ik_llama`; switching sets `active_engine`, refused if the target binary has no router mode. |

## Troubleshooting

If the upstream status shows "check failed," `git fetch` couldn't reach GitHub (network issue, or `llama_src` isn't a valid checkout) — check `llama_src` in `config.json` points at a real git clone. If a build fails, the Build Log panel shows the failing `cmake` step's output; prior binaries are always backed up first (to a `bin-backup-<timestamp>` folder next to the build output) so a bad build doesn't leave you without a working server. If flag detection looks wrong (e.g. no GPU found on a machine that has one), verify `nvidia-smi` is on `PATH` and reports the GPU — `hardware.detect_gpus()` shells out to it directly.

See also [Models & Tuning](models.md) for the flags the resulting `llama-server` binary exposes, and [config.json Reference](config.md) for `llama_src`, `build_dir`, `server_bin`, and `cmake_flags`.
